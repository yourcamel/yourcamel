				<h3>Terms of Use Agreement</h3>
				<p class="terms">Welcome to Your Camel (“Your Camel," "we," or "us"). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the "Services"). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Your Camel Privacy Policy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Services. Your Camel reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Services ("Users").<br><br>

				PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.<br><br>

				1. Use of Our Services<br>
				Your Camel provides a platform that enables users of Your Camel's Services to arrange and schedule the fulfillment of many different kinds of requests by third party providers of various services (each a "Third Party Provider").<br><br>

				A. Eligibility<br>
				This is a contract between you and Your Camel. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Services. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Your Camel, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.<br><br>

				You must be at least 13 years of age (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction if different than 18) to be eligible to use the Services. Any use or access to the Services by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. Some requests may not be made via the Service by users under 18 or 21 years of age. In certain instances, Your Camel may require you to provide proof of identity to create your account, or to access or use the Services, and you acknowledge and agree that you may be denied access or use of the Services if you refuse to provide such proof. The Services are not available to any Users previously removed from the Services by Your Camel.<br><br>

				B. Your Camel Services<br>
				Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Services for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Services.

Your Camel may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.<br><br>

				Your Camel accounts gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Your Camel account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) "you" includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity's behalf. By connecting to Your Camel with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service. You may never use another User's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date account information may result in your inability to access and use the Services or our termination of this Agreement.<br><br>

You must notify Your Camel immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Your Camel will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.<br><br>

We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Services and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by emailing us at textyourcamel@gmail.com. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.<br><br>

				We may, without prior notice, change the Services; stop providing the Services or features of the Services, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Services. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Services without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.<br><br>

				You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Your Camel shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User's action or inaction.<br><br>

To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Software. Your Camel does not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Software and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services.

Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and Your Camel or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void.

				11. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver<br>
				A. Governing Law.<br> You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in Maryland; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Maryland. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Maryland, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Rockville, Maryland for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Rockville, Maryland is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.<br><br>

				B. Arbitration.<br> READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MAGIC. For any dispute with Your Camel, you agree to first contact us at textyourcamel@gmail.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Your Camel has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Rockville, Maryland, unless you and Your Camel agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Your Camel from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.<br><br>

				C. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.<br> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND YOUR CAMEL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.<br><br>

				12. General<br>
				A. Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Your Camel without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.<br><br>

				B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.<br> Your Camel may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Your Camel in our sole discretion. Your Camel reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement.

Your continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Services.<br><br>

				C. Entire Agreement/Sever-ability.<br> This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Your Camel in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Your Camel concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.<br><br>

				D. No Waiver.<br> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Your Camel's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br><br>

				E. Contact.<br> Please contact us at contact@yourcamel.com with any questions regarding this Agreement. This Agreement was last modified on 8/16/2015.</p>
